# Bakery Website - CTEC3905  Assignment
- - - - 

## What is the website about ##

The purpose of this website was to create an online
shop to allow customers to buy products online and 
expand my parents' company allowing people to learn
more about the company. The website shows a logo image at
the top-left corner and 3 buttons (Contact, Products, Basket
icon) at the top-right corner. However, at the bottom of every
HTML file I created we can find the opening hours of bakeries.

## Main page (index.html) ##

The main page of this website presents a small description of
the company, explaining what the bakery is known for and how
long they are in business. I made that using "<p>" as a
paragraph and "<h>" as headings. Below the text, we can see 2 
images presenting the owners, with a small description below.

## Contact us page (contact.html) ##

When the user decides to click the "Contact" button, there is an
information presented on how and when to contact the company,
contact details are included as well. If a person wants to have
face-to-face inquiry, at the bottom of the site there is a map
displayed with pointed locations where the bakery shops are 
located.

## Products page (products.html) ##

The products page introduces the customers to the various range of
products available to purchase. Multiple images are displayed for the
purpose of showing how exactly the product looks. Below every image,
there is a button to add a given product to the basket. However, if
a customer wants to buy 1 specific kind of product, he can click 1 of 3
available buttons (Bread, Pastry, All) to find what is desired.

## Basket page (basket.html) ##

Last, but not least, the basket page is responsible for summarizing the
customer's order. In the table, there is a summary of the products selected,
the quantity, the price of the selected product, and the total price. After ensuring
that the shopping list is correct, the user clicks the "Buy" button and the message
is displayed confirming that the order has been accepted.
